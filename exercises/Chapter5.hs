-- 1. Using a list comprehension, give an expression that calculates the sum
-- 1^2 + 2^2 _ ... + 100^2 of the first 100 integer squares.
sumOfSquares :: Integer
sumOfSquares = sum [x^2 | x <- [1..100]]


-- 2. Using a list comprehension, define a function grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]
-- that returns a coordinate grid of a given size.
grid :: Int -> Int -> [(Int,Int)]
grid m n = [(x,y) | x <- [0..m], y <- [0..n]]


-- 3. Using a list comprehension and the function grid above, 
-- define a function square :: Int -> [(Int, Int)] that returns a coordinate
-- square of size n, excluding the diagonal from (0,0) to (n,n).
squareNoDiagonal :: Int -> [(Int, Int)]
squareNoDiagonal n = [(x,y) | (x,y) <- grid n n, x /= y]


-- 4. In a similar way to the function length, show how the library function
-- replicate :: Int -> a -> [a] that produces a list of identical elements can
-- be defined using a list comprehension.
lengthEx :: [a] -> Int
lengthEx xs = sum [1 | _ <- xs]

replicateEx :: Int -> a -> [a]
replicateEx n x = [ x | _ <- [1..n] ]


-- 5. Using a list comprehension with 3 generators, define a function that returns the list of
-- all such triples whose components are at most a given limit.
pyths :: Int -> [(Int, Int, Int)]
pyths n = [(x,y,z) | x <- [1..n], y <- [1..n], z <- [1..n], x^2 + y^2 == z^2]


-- 6. A positive integer is perfect if it equals the sum of all of its factors, excluding the number itself.
-- Using a list comprehension and the functions factors, define a function that 
-- returns the list of all perfect numbers up to a given limit.
perfects :: Int -> [Int]
perfects n = [x | x <- [1..n], sum (init (factorsEx x)) == x]
  where
    factorsEx n = [x | x <- [1..n], mod n x == 0]


-- 7. Show how the list comprehension [(x,y) | x <- [1,2], y <- [3,4]] with 2 generators can be
-- re-expressed using two comprehensions with single generators.
sol7 = concat [[(x,y) | y <- [3,4]] | x <- [1,2]] -- "2 dimensions"
sol7_2 = concat[ concat[ [ (x,y,z) | z <- [1,2] ] | y <- ['a','b']] | x <- ['@','#']] -- "3 dimensions"


-- 8. Redefine the function positions using the function find.

-- Return a list of all values mapped to a given key, 
-- from a list of key-value pairs.
findEx :: Eq a => a -> [(a,b)] -> [b]
findEx k t = [v | (k', v) <- t, k' == k]

-- Return a list of all positions at which a value occurs in a list, by 
-- pairing each element with its position, and selecting those positions at which
-- the desired value occurs.
positionsOfValInListEx :: Eq a => a -> [a] -> [Int]
positionsOfValInListEx x xs = findEx x (zip xs [0..])


-- 9. The scalar product of two lists is the sum of the products of the corresponding integers.
-- In a similar manner to chisqr, show how a list comprehension can be used to define a function
-- scalarproduct :: [Int] -> [Int] -> Int that returns the scalar product of two lists.

chisqrEx :: [Float] -> [Float] -> Float
chisqrEx os es = sum [((o - e)^2)/e | (o,e) <- zip os es]

scalarproduct xs ys = sum [ (x * y) | (x,y) <- zip xs ys]


-- 10. Modify the Caesar cipher program to also handle upper-case letters.

-- Return the integer between 0 and 57 corresponding to the letter and special character.
-- The special characters (located at positions 26 to 31) are: '[', '\', ']', '^', '_', '`' 
let2intEx :: Char -> Int
let2intEx c = ord c - ord 'A'

-- Return the character (including upper-case letters, and one of six special characters) 
-- corresponding to an integer between 0 and 57.
int2letEx :: Int -> Char
int2letEx n = chr (ord 'A' + n)

-- Return the character (letters and one of 6 specials) got after shifting a character,
-- by converting the character into the corresponding integer, adding on the shift factor and
-- taking the remainder when divided by 58, and converting the resulting
-- integer back into a character (letters and one of 6 specials).
-- Do not shift any other characters.
shiftEx :: Int -> Char -> Char
shiftEx n c
  | isLower c || isUpper c || c == '[' || c == '\\' || c == ']' || c == '^' || c == '_' || c == '`' 
    = int2letEx (mod (let2intEx c + n) 58)
  | otherwise = c

-- Return a string (containing both letters, lower- and upper-case, and the 6 special characters) which is encoded by
-- using the shift function and a shift factor.
encodeCaesarEx :: Int -> String -> String
encodeCaesarEx n xs = [shiftEx n x | x <- xs]
