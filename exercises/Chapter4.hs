-- 1. Using library functions define a function halve :: [a] -> ([a],[a]) that splits an even-lengthed list into two halves.
halve :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
halve [] = ([],[])
halve xs = (take ((length xs) `div` 2) xs, drop ((length xs) `div` 2) xs)

halve' :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
halve' xs = (take n xs, drop n xs)
              where n = (length xs) `div` 2

halve'' :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
halve'' xs = splitAt n xs
              where n = (length xs) `div` 2

-- 2. Define a function third :: [a] -> a that returns the third element in a list that contains at least this many elements using:
-- a. head and tail;
-- b. list indexing !!;
-- c. pattern matching.
thirdA :: [a] -> a
thirdA xs = head (tail (tail xs))

thirdB :: [a] -> a
thirdB xs = xs !! 2

thirdC :: [a] -> a
thirdC (x:x2:x3:xs) = x3


-- 3. Consider a function safetail :: [a] -> [a] that behaves the same way as tail does except that it maps the empty list to itself rather than producing an error.
-- Using tail and the function null :: [a] -> Bool that decides if a list is empty or not, define safetail using:
-- a. a conditional expression;
-- b. guarded equations;
-- c. pattern matching.

-- a. a conditional expression;
safetail_a :: [a] -> [a]
safetail_a xs = 
  if listNull xs
    then []
    else tail xs

-- b. guarded equations;
safetail_b :: [a] -> [a]
safetail_b xs 
  | listNull xs = []
  | otherwise = tail xs

-- c. pattern matching.
safetail_c :: [a] -> [a]
safetail_c [] = []
safetail_c (_:xs) = xs


-- 4. In a similar way to && in section 4.4, show how the disjunction operator || can be defined in four different ways using pattern matching.
or_logical :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
or_logical False False = False
or_logical False True = True
or_logical True False = True
or_logical True True = True

or_logical2 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
or_logical2 False False = False
or_logical2 True _ = True

or_logical3 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
or_logical3 False b = b
or_logical3 True b = True

or_logical4 :: Bool -> Bool -> Bool
or_logical4 b b1 
    | b == b1 = b
    | otherwise = True

listNull :: [a] -> Bool
listNull [] = True
listNull xs = False
  

-- 7. Show how the meaning of the following curried functions definition can be formalised in terms of lambda expressions.
multL :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
-- multL x y z = x * y * z
multL = \x -> \y -> \z -> x * y * z

-- 8. Define a function luhnDouble::Int->Int that doubles a digit and subtracts 9 if the result is greater than 9.
-- Using luhnDouble and `mod`, define a function luhn::Int->Int->Int->Int->Bool that decides if a four-digit bank card number is valid.
luhn :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int -> Bool
luhn i j k l 
  | mod (luhnDouble i + j + luhnDouble k + l) 10 == 0 = True
  | otherwise = False


luhnDouble :: Int -> Int
luhnDouble n 
    | n*2 < 9   = n*2
    | otherwise = (n*2 - 9)
